### SYNCHRONOUS-UP-COUNTER

**AIM:**

To implement 4 bit synchronous up counter and validate functionality.

**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:**

Quartus prime

**THEORY**

**4 bit synchronous UP Counter**

If we enable each J-K flip-flop to toggle based on whether or not all preceding flip-flop outputs (Q) are “high,” we can obtain the same counting sequence as the asynchronous circuit without the ripple effect, since each flip-flop in this circuit will be clocked at exactly the same time:

Each flip-flop in this circuit will be clocked at exactly the same time.
The result is a four-bit synchronous “up” counter. Each of the higher-order flip-flops are made ready to toggle (both J and K inputs “high”) if the Q outputs of all previous flip-flops are “high.”
Otherwise, the J and K inputs for that flip-flop will both be “low,” placing it into the “latch” mode where it will maintain its present output state at the next clock pulse.
Since the first (LSB) flip-flop needs to toggle at every clock pulse, its J and K inputs are connected to Vcc or Vdd, where they will be “high” all the time.
The next flip-flop need only “recognize” that the first flip-flop’s Q output is high to be made ready to toggle, so no AND gate is needed.
However, the remaining flip-flops should be made ready to toggle only when all lower-order output bits are “high,” thus the need for AND gates.

**RESULT**
 The 4-bit synchronous up-counter was successfully implemented using Verilog in Quartus Prime. The functionality was validated by simulating the counter, which correctly counted up from 0000 to 1111 in binary, incrementing by 1 on each clock pulse. The synchronous nature of the counter ensured that all flip-flops were clocked simultaneously, with each flip-flop toggling based on the state of the preceding flip-flops. The output sequence followed the expected counting pattern, confirming the correct operation of the 4-bit synchronous up-counter.
